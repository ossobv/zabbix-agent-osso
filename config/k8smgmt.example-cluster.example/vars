# Optional: if you don't care about "waitingPods", that is pods that are
# waiting to be started for a long while, you can set
# DISABLE_WAITINGPODS=1. This will force the waitingPods value to 0, so
# you will not get triggers for that event for this cluster.
# Use this for clusters where the admins regularly spawn
# CrashLoopBackOff pods and don't fix them in a timely manner.
#DISABLE_WAITINGPODS=1  # pretends that waiting pod count is zero
