k8s-pods-ready
==============

this script monitors the readiness of the containers in pods, configured by labels on a namespace

to enable this for a namespace label the namespace with:
ossobv/zabbix-agent-osso.k8s-pods-ready=true

to setup for what pods the script should check the container statuses use the following label:
ossobv/zabbix-agent-osso.k8s-pods-ready-startswith=natsomatch

in this example it matches all pods with names that start with `natsomatch`
